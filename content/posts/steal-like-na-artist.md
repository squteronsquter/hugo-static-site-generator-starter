**#steallikeanartist**

## Why run your own blog & who would need to read it?

Your own blog is and will remain to be the only source of truth about your artistic activity as long as you pay your hosting bills.

**Social networks**  are like garbage bins being filled, day in day out, with all sorts of useless stuff.
__Facebooks__, __Instagrams__ and __Twitters__ of today will become __TikToks__ and __WhatNots__ of tomorrow.

Where do you think will your thoughts and sketches go when all these social networks evaporate in the meltingpot of the forgery of the Mighty Future? 

They will vanish in the thin air of the faint human memory.

- Do you want this to happen to your legacy?
- Do you want to be a meaningless piece of trash in the ocean of garbage?
- Do you want to struggle daily to grab the attention of people who do not care for what you are or what you do?
- Did these two preceding questions bother you enough to think of starting your blog?

## Are you ready to start your blog and continue to preserve your thoughts to yourself?

**Good**. Maybe one day, Your blog will be the only survivor of the looming catastrophe of all the great and shiny social media pile of shit.

Well done! Now You are ready to **steal like an artist** or be robbed like an artist.

Did anybody tell you that there is nothing new since we crawled out of the *Lascaux Cave*. Everything has been written and drawn before. So why bother?

Well. That's what this blog is all about.
